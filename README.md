![Price Distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lakshya189/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Cars-Dataset-Assignment/master/visualization/price_distribution.png)

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a car dataset, examining various aspects of car specifications and pricing patterns.

## Key Visualizations

### 1. Price Distribution
![Price Distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lakshya189/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Cars-Dataset-Assignment/master/visualization/price_distribution.png)
- Shows the distribution of car prices across different market segments
- Highlights the concentration of prices in different ranges
- Identifies premium and luxury vehicle segments

### 2. Engine Power vs Price
![Engine HP vs Price](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lakshya189/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Cars-Dataset-Assignment/master/visualization/hp_vs_price.png)
- Demonstrates the relationship between engine power and vehicle price
- Shows how higher HP generally correlates with higher prices
- Identifies price thresholds at different HP levels

### 3. Fuel Efficiency Analysis
![MPG Relationship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lakshya189/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Cars-Dataset-Assignment/master/visualization/mpg_relationship.png)
- Shows the relationship between highway and city fuel efficiency
- Highlights the strong positive correlation
- Identifies efficiency clusters across different vehicle types

### 4. Market Segmentation
![Price by Make](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lakshya189/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Cars-Dataset-Assignment/master/visualization/price_by_make.png)
- Shows price distribution across different car makes
- Highlights distinct market segments
- Demonstrates pricing strategies across brands

## Project Structure

- `Cars_data.csv`: Original dataset containing car specifications
- `EDA_Assignment_Day_14.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code
- `EDA_Assignment_Day_14_Completed.ipynb`: Completed version of the analysis notebook
- `Car_Analysis_Presentation.pptx`: Professional presentation of the analysis results
- `cleaned_cars_data.csv`: Cleaned version of the dataset
- `*.png`: Visualization plots generated during analysis

## Analysis Components

1. **Price Analysis**:
   - Distribution of car prices
   - Relationship between engine power and price
   - Price segmentation by car make

2. **Engine Analysis**:
   - Engine power distribution
   - Relationship between engine specifications and price
   - Cylinders distribution

3. **Fuel Efficiency**:
   - Highway vs City MPG relationship
   - Efficiency patterns across different vehicles

4. **Market Analysis**:
   - Price distribution across different car makes
   - Market segmentation analysis
   - Pricing strategies across brands

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
  - python-pptx

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages
3. Run the notebook `EDA_Assignment_Day_14.ipynb` to reproduce the analysis
4. Review the presentation for analysis results

## Key Findings

1. **Market Segmentation**:
   - Clear distinction between economy and luxury segments
   - Significant price variation across different car makes
   - Strong correlation between technical specifications and pricing

2. **Technical Specifications**:
   - Higher HP engines generally found in premium/luxury vehicles
   - Most cars have highway MPG between 20-30 mpg
   - 4-cylinder engines are most common

3. **Pricing Patterns**:
   - Luxury brands have distinct price distributions
   - Engine specifications significantly influence pricing
   - Some makes show more consistent pricing while others have high variability

## Recommendations

1. For Manufacturers:
   - Optimize pricing strategy based on market positioning
   - Consider fuel efficiency in pricing decisions
   - Analyze competitor pricing patterns

2. For Consumers:
   - Consider both price and specifications when purchasing
   - Understand market segments and price ranges
   - Compare technical specifications across different price points
