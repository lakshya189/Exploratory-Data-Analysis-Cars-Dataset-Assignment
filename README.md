# Car Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the analysis of a car dataset, exploring various aspects of car specifications and pricing.

## Project Structure

- `Cars_data.csv`: Original dataset containing car specifications
- `EDA_Assignment_Day_14.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code
- `EDA_Assignment_Day_14_Completed.ipynb`: Completed version of the analysis notebook
- `Car_Analysis_Presentation.pptx`: Professional presentation of the analysis results
- `cleaned_cars_data.csv`: Cleaned version of the dataset
- `*.png`: Visualization plots generated during analysis

## Analysis Components

1. **Price Analysis**:
   - Distribution of car prices
   - Relationship between engine power and price
   - Price segmentation by car make

2. **Engine Analysis**:
   - Engine power distribution
   - Relationship between engine specifications and price
   - Cylinders distribution

3. **Fuel Efficiency**:
   - Highway vs City MPG relationship
   - Efficiency patterns across different vehicles

4. **Market Analysis**:
   - Price distribution across different car makes
   - Market segmentation analysis
   - Pricing strategies across brands

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
  - python-pptx

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages
3. Run the notebook `EDA_Assignment_Day_14.ipynb` to reproduce the analysis
4. Review the presentation for analysis results

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations that help understand the data:
